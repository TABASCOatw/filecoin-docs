## From an exchange that supports Filecoin Eth-style (0x) accounts

The following exchanges support withdrawing directly to Filecoin Eth-style (0x) addresses:

- Anchorage
- Bittrex
- Btcturk
- Coinbase
- Kraken

## From a cold wallet or exchange that does not yet support Filecoin Eth-style (0x) accounts

If your exchange or wallet does not yet support Filecoin Eth-style (0x) addresses, then you will need to create a new wallet to "relay" the funds through. You can create a Glif "Burner" wallet or use Glif wallet with a Ledger device as described above. 

## From another Filecoin Eth-style (0x) account

The process is exactly the same as [Sending to another Eth-style (0x) address](#sending-to-another-eth-style-0x-address).
