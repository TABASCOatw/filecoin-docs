## Exchanges

A cryptocurrency exchange is a digital platform where users can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies for other cryptocurrencies or traditional fiat currencies like USD, EUR, or JPY.

Crypto exchanges provide a marketplace for users to trade their digital assets and are typically run by private companies that facilitate these transactions. These exchanges can differ in terms of fees, security protocols, and the variety of cryptocurrencies they support.

Users can typically sign up for an account with a crypto exchange, deposit funds into their account, and then use those funds to purchase or sell cryptocurrencies at the current market price. Some exchanges offer advanced trading features like margin trading, stop-loss orders, and trading bots.

It's important to note that while crypto exchanges can offer convenience and liquidity for traders, they also come with risks like hacking and regulatory uncertainty. Therefore, users should take precautions to protect their funds and do their own research before using any particular exchange.

### Supported exchanges

Due to the huge number of cryptocurrencies available, not all exchanges support _all_ cryptocurrencies. One way to find exchanges that support Filecoin is to look at the available markets on a coin-price website. For example, Coinmarketcap.com lists available markets under the [**Markets** tab for Filecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/filecoin/markets/).

### Fund and withdraw

Some exchanges allow users to fund and withdraw FIL using any of the [Filecoin address type]({{< relref "/basics/the-blockchain/addresses" >}}). However, some exchanges only support one, or a handful, of the available address types. Most exchanges do not currently support {{< tooltip "f410 addresses" >}}.

If your exchange does not yet support Filecoin Eth-style 0x addresses, you must create a wallet to _relay_ the funds through. Take a look at the [Transer FIL page]({{< relref "basics/assets/transfer-fil" >}}) for details on how to transfer your funds safely.

## Test FIL

If you're looking to get FIL to test your applications on a testnet, like Hyperspace or Calibration, then check how to [Get test tokens]({{< relref "/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/get-test-tokens" >}})! Test FIL is often referred to as tFIL.
