## Exchanges

An cryptocurrency exchange is a digital platform where users can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies for other cryptocurrencies or traditional fiat currencies like USD, EUR, or JPY.

Crypto exchanges provide a marketplace for users to trade their digital assets and are typically run by private companies that facilitate these transactions. These exchanges can differ in terms of their fees, security protocols, and the variety of cryptocurrencies that they support.

Users can typically sign up for an account with a crypto exchange, deposit funds into their account, and then use those funds to purchase or sell cryptocurrencies at the current market price. Some exchanges also offer advanced trading features like margin trading, stop-loss orders, and trading bots.

It's important to note that while crypto exchanges can offer convenience and liquidity for traders, they also come with risks like hacking and regulatory uncertainty. Therefore, users should take precautions to protect their funds and do their own research before using any particular exchange.

### Supported exchanges

Due to the huge number of differnet cryptocurrencies available, not all exchanges support _all_ cryptocurrencies. One way to find exchanges that support Filecoin is to look at the available markets on a coin-price website. For example, Coinmarketcap.com lists available markets under the [**Markets** tab for Filecoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/filecoin/markets/).
