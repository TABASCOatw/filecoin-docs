Transferring FIL from one address to another is fairly straight-forward. However, if you're transferring from the Ethereum-style (Eth-style) `0x` address type to an `f1`, `f2`, or `f3` address, then there are some special procedures you need to follow. Failure to follow these procedures _could_ result in a loss of funds.

## Transfer methods

There are four paths for transferring funds in the Filecoin network right now:

- From or to a Filecoin address.
- From or to an Ethereum-style address.

Use the form below to find out which type of transfer you should use:
