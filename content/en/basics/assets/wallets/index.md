When someone sends cryptocurrency to your wallet address, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain network and the funds are added to your wallet balance. Similarly, when you send cryptocurrency from your wallet to someone else's wallet, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain network and the funds are deducted from your wallet balance.

There are various types of cryptocurrency wallets, including desktop, mobile, hardware, and web-based wallets, each with their own unique features and levels of security. It's important to choose a reputable and secure wallet to ensure the safety of your digital assets.

### Hot versus cold

Hot wallet refers to any wallet which is permanently connected to the internet. They can be mobile, desktop, or browser based. Hot wallets make it faster and easier to access digital access, but being could be vulnerable to online attacks. Therefore, it is recommended to keep large balances in cold wallets and only use hot wallets to hold funds you need to access frequently.

Cold wallets most commonly refer to hardware wallet devices shaped like a USB stick. They are typically offline, and only connected to the internet for transactions. Accessing a cold wallet typically requires physical possession of the device plus knowledge of the private key, which makes them more resistant to loss via theft. Cold wallets can be less convenient, and are most useful for storing larger balances securely. 

### Security

Wallets that have gone through an audit have had their codebase checked by a recognized security firm for security vulnerabilities and potential leaks. However, just because a wallet has had an audit does not mean that itâ€™s 100% bug-proof. Be incredibly cautious when using unaudited wallets.

Never share your seed phrase, password, or private keys. Bad actors will often use social engineering tactics such as phishing emails or posing as customer service or tech support to lure users into handing over their private key or seed phrase.
